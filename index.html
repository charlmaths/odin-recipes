        We must write 'rel' which is shortened for relationship, it basically defines the relationship between
        linked sources! so the relationship of this link to this HTML doc is that it is the stylesheet, we must use rel
        all the time when we are using link tags. Now the href a.k.a hypertext reference, is the attritube that connects
        this html to the css document we made -->
