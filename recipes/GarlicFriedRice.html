        <h2>Descriptions</h2>
        <p>Garlic fried rice - a staple filipino dish, honestly you can have it anytime - usually have it for breakfast</p>
        <h2>Ingridients</h2>
        <p>The ingridients are simple - we just have to make the garlic oil and basically fry the rice on it</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Garlic - I mean... loads.</li>
            <li>Oil - up to you, I tend to put at least 8 tsp, I drown the garlic in it, we are not going to use it all
                but we can use it for other stuff!
            </li>
            <li>Rice - Again really depends on how much rice u got I would say 1 cup = 1 person </li>
            <li>Salt - Again, up to you! </li>
            <li>Scallion - For garnish - but you can cook the white side with the garlic </li>
            <li>Eggs (optional - but I really like adding it)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook rice (Preferably cold)</li>
            <li>Fry garlic in oil until its golden brown - Slow and steady, gotta get that garlic flavour into the oil</li>
            <li>Put the rice in and mix! put salt too</li>
            <li>If you do decide to put eggs, I'd put salt in the eggs then mix it here, you gotta mix it until the eggs are fried</li>
        </ol>
